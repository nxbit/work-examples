**The Opportunity**: When leaders would meet with their employees, they need a quick way to become familar with that employee.

**The Solution**: Employee Profile page that provides all the nessarly upfront information a leader needs on an employee:

- Profile Picture
- Employee Identification Info
- Status with Company
- Historical Info
  - Reporting Hierarchy
  - Tenureship
  - Coachings / Past Interactions
- Perstant Info
  - Higher Leadership Notes (Only Avaialble to certain levels of leadership)
  - Leadership Notes (Available to the first level of leadership and up)

**The Enhancements**: The Profile page being used as a landing page presented itself with opportunity to place additional data points/portals and information infront of the leadership:

- Employee Performance Values (Charts)
- Apps Launcher
- Easy Feedback Form
- Easy Employee Search

## Links, IPs, Paths, basically anything identifiable and unique to the workplace has been edited out.
